"A day without laughter is a day wasted." 
"From there to here, and here to there, funny things are everywhere."
"A good laugh overcomes more difficulties and dissipates more dark clouds than any other one thing."
"There is nothing like a gleam of humor to reassure you that a fellow human being is ticking inside a strange face."
"A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life." 
"Humor is perhaps a sense of intellectual perspective: an awareness that some things are really important, others not; and that the two kinds are most oddly jumbled in everyday affairs."
