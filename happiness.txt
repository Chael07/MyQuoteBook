"Happiness depends upon ourselves." 
"Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."
"The moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise. It is not that we seize them, but that they seize us."
"Even if happiness forgets you a little bit, never completely forget about it."
"One of the secrets of a happy life is continuous small treats."
"The only joy in the world is to begin."
"The pleasure which we most rarely experience gives us greatest delight."
